                    <p>
                        [Chorus]<br>
All I hear is pretty please, pretty please<br>
Everybody's on their knees like, "I really want to ride with you. But I don't want to die with" yeah<br>
<p>
[Verse: 1]<br>
Most of youse on nine lives these copycats starting to sound repetitive<br>
They ran out of things to call me my phone's been dead just leave a message<br>
The only thing that I see is average so I give them B's<br>
To make them feel better<br>
Claiming that they keep it 100, but hey I think you need some extra credit<br>
A lot of things that I've seen and heard but I mind my business and I never question<br>
A lot of people ask for how-to's like I'm still in school giving out lessons<br>
Starting to think that I'm a scientist the way they always asking for my formula<br>
Now every rapper want to have a band I guess I gotta switch it to a orchestra<br>
Josh said he want to be a barber so I cut him out and I switch drummers<br>
Steve Wonder probably saw it coming cause he did never get along with Ruffin<br>
Late nights rehearsing at the church cause he didn't know the songs like a bad concussion<br>
He never did like to listen by the time you hear this verse it won't mean nothing<br>
Brought Juno back down from Little Rock the team back together I got all my starters<br>
Gotta prove we made the right decision, gotta work harder cause he's now a father<br>
Dodging every single obstacle so I don't end up in a cubicle<br>
While I sit here and watch my band play at my gran's funeral<br>
<p>
[Bridge]<br>
They be like, "I ain't trying to gas you up<br>
But right before you pass me up I really love your drive<br>
So can I please ride with you I want to be down with you."<br>
Yeah<br>
<p>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
And all I hear is, "Pretty please, pretty please."<br>
Everybody's on their knees like, "I really want to ride with you<br>
I want to be down with you<br>
And all I hear is, "Pretty please, pretty please."<br>
Everybody's on their knees like, "I really want to ride with you but I don't want to die with you."<br>
Cool<br>
<p>
[Skit]<br>
Yeezus<br>
Got the Yeezys<br>
Yeah my Yeezys real, don't try to play my Yeezys cuh<br>
Know what I'm saying<br>
Got 'em straight from Kanye himself<br>
<p>
[Verse: 2]<br>
It's Aha<br>
Let's get it poppin<br>
Like a bag of chips, I'm too equipped, so there ain't no stopping<br>
They want protection from this rapper but I ain't a condom<br>
I'm extra saucy, they extra salty, don't look inside them<br>
I don't look like what I've been through in life, it don't add up and so they have a problem, they don't have the knowledge, can't <br>comprehend it cause it ain't they business<br>
Look at my numbers and it makes them wonder<br>
But it doesn't matter cause this ain't statistics<br>
They like Aha you doing the most<br>
And I'm like not at all God did it<br>
His hands on me, all ten fingers, that's ten minutes, it's nine fifty, I'm ten deep, that's nine sixty, that's down to go commit crimes with me<br>
I'm just playing, but really know I'm just saying don't come and pick a fight with me<br>
Got a ten piece that's fried crispy<br>
I like to rap a lot cause I'm gifted<br>
And I like to sing I got the choir with me<br>
I'm never tripping because God lifts me<br>
Everybody trying to ride with me<br>
Wanna get fat up off the pie with me<br>
Wanna run away when it's time to roll, but don't get ran over cause the tire slippery<br>
Counting money ain't the only thing, you still gotta have some accountability<br>
Liars only have one skill, that's prolly why they called liabilities<br>
I gotta my families, and I got my friends I keep it all inside like parenthesis<br>
They just mad that I'm the real version of everything that they pretend to be<br>
But when I get paid and disappear, just promise that you don't get mad at me<br>
Let's make it clear, I'm just a rapper, I'm not a pastor, I never said I'd be<br>
<p> 
<p>
[Bridge]<br>
They be like, "I ain't trying to gas you up<br>
But right before you pass me up<br>
Can I please ride with you I want to be down with you"<br>
<p>
[Chorus]<br>
And all I hear is, "Pretty please, pretty please"<br>
Everybody is on their knees like, "I really want to ride with you<br>
                    </p>
